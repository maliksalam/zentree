The master asked him, “What do you intend to accomplish by sitting in meditation?” Mazu said, “I intend to become an awakened one.” The master then picked up a piece of ceramic roofing tile from the ground and began polishing it. Mazu asked, “What are you doing?” The master said, “I'm polishing this tile to make a mirror.” Mazu asked, “How are you going to make a mirror by polishing a tile?” The master said, “How are you going to make an awakened one by sitting in meditation?” Mazu was taken aback. After a pause he asked, “What is the correct way?” The master said, “Think about driving an ox-cart. When it stops moving do you whip the cart or the ox?” Mazu didn't answer. Then Master Nanyue said, “Is your sitting an attempt to practice Zen, or to be an awakened one? If you really understand what Zen-sitting is, you'd know that Zen is not about sitting or lying down. If you want to know the sitting of an awakened one, then you must understand that awakening has no fixed form. In this ephemeral, changing world, you should give up both grasping and rejecting. If you sit in order to become awakened, you destroy awakening. If you're attached to the form of sitting, then you haven't yet reached the essential understanding. When Mazu heard this, he felt like he had drunk sweet nectar.\",\n",

Tao-wu master knew him as a boy, and recognized in him great spiritual potentialities. He housed his family in a hut belonging to his monastery. To show his gratitude, Longtan made a daily offering of ten cakes to the master. The master accepted the cakes, but every day he consumed only nine and returned the remaining one to Longtan, saying, “This is my gift to you in order to prosper your descendants.” One day, Longtan became curious, saying to himself, “It is I who bring him the cakes; how is it then that he returns one of them as a present to me? Can there be some secret meaning in this?” So the young boy made bold to put the question before the master. The master said, “What wrong is there to restore to you what originally belonged to you?” Longtan apprehended the hidden meaning, and decided to be a novice, attending upon the master with great diligence. After some time, Longtan said to the master, “Since I came, I have not received any essential instructions on the mind from you, master.” The master replied, “Ever since you came, I have not ceased for a moment to give you essential instructions about the mind.” More mystified than ever, the disciple asked, “On what points have you instructed me?” The master replied, “Whenever you bring me the tea, I take it from your hands. Whenever you serve the meal, I accept it and eat it. Whenever you salute me, I lower my head in response. On what points have I failed to show you the essence of the mind?” Longtan lowered his head and remained silent for a long time. The master said, “For true perception, you must see right on the spot. As soon as you begin to ponder and reflect, you miss it.” At these words, Longtan's mind was opened and he understood. Then he asked how to preserve this insight. The master said, “Give rein to your Nature in its transcendental roamings. Act according to the exigencies of circumstances in perfect freedom and without any attachment. Just follow the dictates of your ordinary mind and heart. Aside from that, there is no ‘holy' insight.”.\",\n",

He made a special study of the Diamond Sutra on the basis of the learned commentaries of the Dharma master Ch'ing-lung. He lectured on this sutra so frequently that his contemporaries nicknamed him “Diamond Chou.” Later, hearing about the prosperity of the Zen platform in the south, he became indignant and said, “How many homeleavers have spent a thousand kalpas in studying the Buddhist rituals, and ten thousand kalpas in observing all the minute rules of the Buddha. Even then they have not been able to attain Buddhahood. Now, those little devils of the south are bragging of pointing directly at the mind of man, of seeing one's self-nature and attaining Buddhahood immediately! I am going to raid their dens and caves and exterminate the whole race, in order to requite the Buddha's kindness.” Carrying on a pole two baskets of Ch'ing-lung's commentaries, he left Szechuen for Hunan, where Longtan was teaching. <br>On his way, he encountered an old woman selling pastries, which in Chinese were, and still are, called “mind-refreshers.” Being tired and hungry, he laid down his load and wanted to buy some cakes. The old woman, pointing at the baskets, asked, “What is this literature?” He answered, “Ch'ing-lung's commentaries on the Diamond Sutra.” The old woman said, “I have a question to ask you. If you can answer it, I will make a free gift of the mind-refreshers to you. But if you cannot, please pass on to another place. Now, the Diamond Sutra says: ‘The past mind is nowhere to be found, the present mind is nowhere to be found, and the future mind is nowhere to be found.' Which mind, I wonder, does Your Reverence wish to refresh?” “Deshan had no word to say, and went on to Lung-t'an. After he had arrived at the Dharma hall, he remarked, “I have long desired to visit the Dragon Pond. Now that I am here on the very spot, I see neither pond nor dragon.” At that time, the master Longtan came out and said to him, “Yes, indeed, you have personally arrived at the true Dragon Pond.” Deshan again had nothing to say. He decided to stay on for the time being. <br>One evening, as he was attending on the master, the latter said, “The night is far advanced. Why don't you retire to your own quarters?” After wishing the master good night, he went out, but returned at once, saying, “It's pitch dark outside!” Longtan lit a paper-candle and handed it over to him. But just as he was on the point of receiving the candle, Longtan suddenly blew out the light. At this point, Deshan was completely enlightened, and did obeisance to the master. The master asked, “What have you seen?” Deshan said, “From now on, I have no more doubt about the tongues of the old monks of the whole world.” <br>Next morning, the master ascended to his seat and declared to the assembly, “Among you there is a fellow, whose teeth are like the sword-leaf tree, whose mouth is like a blood-basin. Even a sudden stroke of the staff on his head will not make him turn back. Some day he will build up my doctrine on the top of a solitary peak.” On the same day, Deshan brought all the volumes of Ch'ing-lung's Commentaries to the front of the hall, and, raising a torch, said, “An exhaustive discussion of the abstruse is like a hair thrown into the infinite void, and the fullest exertion of all capabilities is like a little drop of water falling into an unfathomable gulf.” Thereupon he set the commentaries to fire.\",\n",
