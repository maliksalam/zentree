In his youth, Puji is said to have studied a wide range of Buddhist scriptures before ordaining at the age of thirty-eight. Soon afterwards, he left to study with Shenxiu at Yuquansi (Jade Spring Monastery) on Mt. Dangy ang in Jingzhou. As the best-known disciple of Shenxiu, Puji was one of the subjects of a series of polemical attacks by the HEZE SHENHUI (684–758) beginning in 732. Shenhui denounced Puji and other disciples of Shenxiu as representing a mere collateral branch of BODHIDHARMA's lineage and for promoting what Shenhui called a ""gradual” (jian) approach to enlightenment. Shenhui instead promoted a ""sudden teaching” (DUNJIAO), which he claimed derived from a so-called ""Southern school” (NAN ZONG) founded by HUINENG (638–713), whom Shenhui claimed was the true successor of the fifth patriarch HONGREN (601–74). Later Chan historians such as GUIFENG ZONGMI (780–841) came to refer to a ""Northern school” (Bei zong) of Chan to describe this lineage of Shenxiu's, to which Puji, Yifu (661–736), and XIANGMO ZANG (d.u.) were said to have belonged.",651,739,651,739,,https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/Puji.html

Mazu asked, ""How are you going to make a mirror by polishing a tile?"" The master said, ""How are you going to make an awakened one by sitting in meditation?"" Mazu was taken aback. After a pause he asked, ""What is the correct way?"" The master said, ""Think about driving an ox-cart. When it stops moving do you whip the cart or the ox?"" Mazu didn't answer. Then Master Nanyue said, ""Is your sitting an attempt to practice Zen, or to be an awakened one? If you really understand what Zen-sitting is, you'd know that Zen is not about sitting or lying down. If you want to know the sitting of an awakened one, then you must understand that awakening has no fixed form. In this ephemeral, changing world, you should give up both grasping and rejecting. If you sit in order to become awakened, you destroy awakening. If you're attached to the form of sitting, then you haven't yet reached the essential understanding.

Mazu Daoyi,Ma Jo,Baso Doitsu,Nanyue Huairang,"Founder of the Hongzhou school; said to have transmitted the dharma to 84 disciples (some sources say 139), of whom 13 are particularly well-known. Of the ""Five Houses of Zen"", two emerged from Mazu's descendants: the Linji (Rinzai) and Guiyang (Igyo) Houses. Certain distinctive attributes of Linji Zen are already evident in the record we have of Mazu, Linji's dharma great-grandfather. For instance, many of the teaching devices that came to be identified with Zen, especially Linji's Zen -- e.g., shouts, blows, enigmatic questions -- were first used by Mazu.

Heng, he moved to Lujian (in modern Anhui province) where he studied Buddhist scriptures. Then, while still in his twenties, he sought out Master Mazu at Gonggong Mountain in southern Jiangxi and became his disciple.
Baizhang established an early set of rules for Chan monastic discipline, the Pure Rules of Baizhang, and is also credited with originating the Chinese tea ceremony. He founded Baizhang monastery, which contained a monks hall, an innovation which became typical for Chan. Both the lifestyle he spelled out as well as the architectural form of his monastery became models for later Zen monasteries. As the Zen monks farmed, it helped them to survive the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution more than other sects which relied more on donations. Baizhang's rules are still used today in many Zen monasteries. His rules include the aphorism, ""A day without work is a day without food.""

However, Baoche was considerably older than Linji, so other commentators suggest that the Mayu mentioned in the Linji-lu is Baoche's disciple, who was presumably the second abbot of Magu. In the Linji-lu Magu appears twice, but it is clear that these are merely two accounts of the same incident.

After receiving ordination at the age of twenty-five, he went traveling, and finally came to study under Mazu Daoyi. In 788, he became Abbot of Saido Temple in Kwangsi Province. Though none of his heirs are listed on the Chinese charts, his disciples included Korean monks Jilin Daoyi and Hongshe. These two adepts transmitted Zen to their native country. There, they helped to establish the ""Nine Mountains"" nine prominent schools of Korean Zen.

Danxia Tianran,Dan Ha,Tanka Tennen,Shitou Xiqian,"Danxia came from Dengzhou. In his youth, he prepared for a career in administration, becoming well educated in Confucian texts. While traveling to the capital, Chang'an, to take the civil service examination, he had a dream that the whole room was filled with white light. Asking a fortune teller about this dream, he was told that his dream foretold a solution to emptiness. He then met a Chan monk, who asked him what his goal was. ""I've decided to become a functionary,"" said Danxia. ""What does the decision to become a functionary amount to compared with the decision to become a buddha?"" replied the monk. ""Where can I go if I want to become a buddha?"" Danxia then asked. The monk suggested that he seek out the great Chan master Mazu, whereupon Danxia unhesitatingly set out to do so. Mazu soon sent him on to Shitou, under whom Danxia trained for some years. He went on to become one of Shitou's dharma successors. Later he returned to Mazu. Arriving in Mazu's monastery he sat himself astride the neck of a statue of Manjushri. The monks, upset by the outrageous behavior of the newcomer, reported this to Mazu, who came to see Danxia. ""You are very natural, my son,"" said Mazu. From this incident Danxia's monastic name Tianran (the Natural) is derived. After the death of Mazu, Danxia went on wandering pilgrimage and visited other great Chan masters of the time in order to train further. For three years he practiced in the monastery at the top of Huading Tiantai mountains. He also practiced for a time with master Jingshan Daoqin (714-792) from niutou school. During his wandering years he stopped to spend the night in a Ch'an temple. The night being cold, he took a wooden buddha off the shrine, made a fire with it, and warmed himself. When the head monk took him to task, Danxia said, ""I'll get the bones of the Buddha out of the ashes."" ""How can you expect to find Buddha's bones in wood?"" asked the head monk. Danxia replied, ""Why are you berating me then for burning the wood?!""
<br>At the age of eighty-one, he settled in a hermitage on Mount Danxia (in Hunan Province) from which his name is derived. Soon up to 300 students gathered there around him and built a monastery. Four years after his arrival on Mount Danxia, he suddenly said one day, ""I'm going on a journey once again."" He picked up his hat and his pilgrim's robe and staff. When he had put on the second of his pilgrim's sandals, he passed away before his foot again touched the ground. Posthumous title: Zhitong chanshi (chan master pervading wisdom).

"Pang Yun ""Layman Pang""",,Ho Koji,Mazu Daoyi,"Master Pangyun was born and grew up in Xiangyang city, Hubei, the son of a government official. When his father was transferred to Hengyang in Hunan, the young man joined him, and in this new city he married and had a daughter. Disillusioned with conventional life early on, Pang resisted the bureaucratic life expected of him, and managed to avoid a government post. Instead he devoted himself to spiritual practice, building a hermitage beside his house where he could focus on meditation. As he became more committed to simplicity, and had been joined by his wife in this pursuit, they donated their house to be made into a temple, and moved into the hermitage. Then they loaded all their valuable possessions onto a raft and sank it in a nearby lake. When asked why he didn't just give them away, Pang said that they had been a source of anxiety for him, and an impediment to the way. How could he wish that on someone else?
<br>After this the Pang family began living off a meager income from crafting and selling bamboo utensils in the street. Soon the layman, already in his forties, decided to travel to meet teachers, and he first set off for the Heng Mountains to the north. There he found his way to the practice place of Master Shitou.
<br>Eventually Pangyun travelled to Jiangxi to meet Master Ma. He asked his old question, ""Who is the one who isn't attached to the ten thousand things?""
Master Ma said, ""When you swallow all the water in the West River in one gulp, then I'll tell you.""
Hearing these words, Pang had another liberating awakening, and all his doubts were resolved. He practiced with Mazu for two years, and then continued his travels and encounters with other monks and teachers.
He stayed for awhile on Medicine Mountain with Master Shitou's disciple Master Yaoshan, and also became close friends with another of Shitou's disciples, the irreverent and free-spirited adept Danxia Tianran. Between excursions he would return to his wife and daughter in Hengyang.
<br>Both his wife and daughter had also become deeply devoted to the spiritual path, and all three were eventually recognized for their clear wisdom. The layman was particularly close to his precocious daughter Lingzhao whose sharp wit could often outdo her father.
<br>Toward the end of his life Pangyun traveled north toward his birthplace of Xiangyang with his beloved daughter Lingzhao, herself now an adept.

Yanguan Qian,Yom Kwan,Enkan Seian,Mazu Daoyi,"Master Yanguan Qi'an was from Haiting county in the modern province of Zhejiang. He grew up in a prominent wealthy family that had relations to the Tang royalty. Entering the monastic life in his youth at a local temple, he later received full ordination at Hengshan in Hunan. Soon after he traveled to Jiangxi where he first encountered Master Ma at Gonggong Mountain. He became a student of the master just before the master's move north, and then followed him to the new monastery in Hongzhou. Studying with the master for many years, he became one of Mazu's most senior disciples.<br>
After the passing of Master Ma, Qi'an was invited to teach in several places, and he eventually settled in a monastery built for him in Yanguan (near Hangzhou in his native province). Helped, no doubt, by his family connections, he soon became a famous teacher and was visited by numerous scholars and dignitaries as well as training monks.<br>
Master Yanguan was once visited by a Japanese monk on a mission from the Empress Tachibana Kachiko of Japan. The monk asked Master Yanguan if he had a disciple he could send to Japan to instruct the Empress, who had become interested in Zen teaching after hearing about it from the monk Kukai, the founder of Japanese esoteric Buddhism (who had traveled in China). Master Yanguan sent his disciple Yikung, who thus became the first Zen teacher in Japan, and the Empress, who later became a nun, became the first Zen student. Yikung, however, eventually returned to China without establishing an enduring following in Japan.<br>
Toward the end of Master Yanguan's long life, the Emperor Wuzong came to power and began to implement a persecution of Buddhist institutions and clergy. Probably because of Yanguan's high-placed connections, his monastery was relatively protected from destruction, and from the defrocking of monks that went on elsewhere. Li Chen, the expected future emperor, came to the safe haven of Yanguan's monastery to keep a low profile for a while during the politically turbulent times. Greatly impressed by the master, when he eventually ascended to the throne and became Emperor Xuanzong, he ended the persecutions and became a generous supporter of the monastic order.

Huangbo Xiyun,Hwang Beok,Obaku Kiun,Baizhang Huaihai,"Born in Fujian, China, Huangbo began his monastic life on Mt. Huangbo (he would later teach at a different monastery with the same name) in Fujian province. During his period of traveling around seeking instructions from various Chan masters, he visited Mt. Tiantai and received teachings from National Teacher Nanyang Huizhong (675-775). He may also have studied briefly under Nanquan Puyuan (748-835) before settling down with Baizhang Huaihai. When Huangbo, who was quite tall, first met Baizhang, Baizhang exclaimed, ""Magnificent! Imposing! Where have you come from?"" Huangbo replied, ""Magnificent and imposing, I've come from the mountains.""
In 842, Pei Xiu, a government official in Kiangsi province, invited Huangbo to be resident teacher at Lung-hsing Monastery. Pei eventually built a monastery for Huángbò around 846, which the master named Huangbo after the mountain where he had been a novice monk.
Central teaching: centered on the concept of ""mind"" (or ""heart/mind"") Mind cannot be sought by the mind. ""Mind is the Buddha,"" he said. ""All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing but the One Mind, beside which nothing exists. The One Mind alone is the Buddha, and there is no distinction between the Buddha and sentient beings."" And: ""To awaken suddenly to the fact that your own Mind is the Buddha, that there is nothing to be attained or a single action to be performed - this is the Supreme Way.""

Longtan Chongxin,,Ryutan Sushin,Tianhuang Daowu,"Longtan came from a poor family, who made their living by selling pastry. Tao-wu master knew him as a boy, and recognized in him great spiritual potentialities. He housed his family in a hut belonging to his monastery. To show his gratitude, Longtan made a daily offering of ten cakes to the master. The master accepted the cakes, but every day he consumed only nine and returned the remaining one to Longtan, saying, ""This is my gift to you in order to prosper your descendants."" One day, Longtan became curious, saying to himself, ""It is I who bring him the cakes; how is it then that he returns one of them as a present to me? Can there be some secret meaning in this?"" So the young boy made bold to put the question before the master. The master said, ""What wrong is there to restore to you what originally belonged to you?"" Longtan apprehended the hidden meaning, and decided to be a novice, attending upon the master with great diligence. After some time, Longtan said to the master, ""Since I came, I have not received any essential instructions on the mind from you, master."" The master replied, ""Ever since you came, I have not ceased for a moment to give you essential instructions about the mind."" More mystified than ever, the disciple asked, ""On what points have you instructed me?"" The master replied, ""Whenever you bring me the tea, I take it from your hands. Whenever you serve the meal, I accept it and eat it. Whenever you salute me, I lower my head in response. On what points have I failed to show you the essence of the mind?"" Longtan lowered his head and remained silent for a long time. The master said, ""For true perception, you must see right on the spot. As soon as you begin to ponder and reflect, you miss it."" At these words, Longtan's mind was opened and he understood. Then he asked how to preserve this insight. The master said, ""Give rein to your Nature in its transcendental roamings. Act according to the exigencies of circumstances in perfect freedom and without any attachment. Just follow the dictates of your ordinary mind and heart. Aside from that, there is no 'holy' insight."".",,,770,850,,
Guishan Lingyou,Wi Sahn,Isan Reiyu,Baizhang Huaihai,"Guishan and his disciple, Yangshan, are the founders of the Gui-Yang House, the first of the fabled ""Five Houses of Zen."" Born in Changxi, Fujian province, he became a Buddhist monk at age 15, and received tonsure ceremony at Shanjian (Build Goodness) Temple in Fujian. He received the monastic precepts at Longxing Temple in Hangzhou where he studied sutra and Vinaya Pitaka. In 794, at age 23, he traveled to Jianxi to study under Baizhang Huaihai. Baizhang permitted Guishan to become his disciple upon their first meeting. In 820, at age 49, he became the abbot of Tongqing Temple in Guishan, Hunan Province. The Guiyang school is characterized by use of symbols, symbolic actions, and metaphors, thus Guiyang Zen is the Zen school most closely aligned to Buddhsm's esoteric schools.

<br>One day a young monk named Shanhui (805–881) came to seek out this monk for instructions. After some exchange of words, Decheng realized the potential of Shanhui, so he posed a question to him. When Shanhui tried to answer, Decheng knocked him off the bot into the river and retorted, ""Speak, speak!"" At this point the young monk became enlightened. Decheng pulled him up and said,""Today I have finally caught a big golden fish!"" The two stayed all night on the river, sometimes talking, sometimes silent. In the morning Decheng bade farewell to Shanhui and left him on the shore. He said to him,""I studied under Yangshan for thirty years. Today I have repaid his kindness.

(Another Chan master, Shishuang Chuyuan, taught at this location about 200 years later.) Shishuang created ""seven instructions to practice,"" short maxims to help his students in meditation, such as ""cold ash or dry wood,"" ""white silk,"" ""censer in an old temple,"" etc. These maxims were criticized, along with ""silent illumination"" generally, by Dahui Zonggao.

Xuefeng Yicun,Seol Bong,Seppo Gison,Deshan Xuanjian,"Xuefeng left home at age 12 to live at Yujian Temple (Putian City). At age 19, the five-year suppression of Buddhism (841-846) forced Xuefeng from the monastery, yet his training continued, now with Yuanzhao on Lotus Mountain (Hunan). When the suppression ended, Xuefeng began traveling around, visiting various monasteries in Northern China before settling down at Wuling (Hunan) to study with Deshan. At length, Deshan authorized him to teach, and Xuefeng returned to Lotus Mountain and built a monastery on the top of Guangfu Xuefeng (Snow Summit), in the Fu Region (Fujian). In the mid-870s, his monastery was officially recognized by the authorities and his teachings were supported by several officials in the region, leading eventually to Xuefeng receiving from Emperor Xizong a purple robe and the title of ""Grand Master of the truly enlightened."" In 891, now almost 70, Xuefeng went traveling again. Soon he joined the attendants of Yang Xingmi, ruler of the newly established Wu regime, ""cleansing soldiers with dharma-rain and performing ceremonies at Chan monasteries"". This strengthened his reputation ""as a Buddhist prelate who administered to the needs of local rulers"". In 894, he returned to the Min region, where he lived out his days as a state prelate, a master with a central role in promoting Buddhism who spread his influence throughout the region. Posthumous name: Great Master Zhenjue. Two of the Five Houses of Zen descend from Xuefeng: the Yunmen school (from Xuefeng's immediate heir, Yunmen), and the Fayan school (from heir Xuansha to Luohan to Fayan).

After his father drowned, in his remorse and despair, Xuansha decided to become a monk and to practice Zen"" (Wick). At the rather late age of thirty he left lay life to enter a temple on Lotus Mountain. Later he was ordained by the Vinaya master Lingxun at Kaiyuan Temple in Yuzhang (near modern Nanchang). He carried on an ascetic practice, wearing only a patched robe and straw sandals. (""With straw sandals, muslin clothing, and turnips for food, he was content"" --Wansong, BOS81). He often fasted instead of taking the evening meal, and was regarded as unusual by the other monks. He was called ""Ascetic Bei.” His relationship with Xuefeng was like that of a younger brother. As his close disciple, Xuansha worked with Xuefeng to build his teacher's practice center. He is said to have awakened one day upon reading the words of the Surangama Sutra. After leaving Xuefeng he first lived at the Puying Monastery. Later he moved to Xuansha Mountain in Fuzhou, where he remained for the next thirty years. The governor of Min honored him, presenting him with the purple robe and the title ""Great Teacher of the One Doctrine.”

He was very short in physical stature, and thus earned the nick-name ""the dwarf teacher.” (Ferguson) He seems to have been a rather contradictory fellow who traveled around a lot to many teachers. In addition to being short, apparently he was also ugly and often sickly. The other monks contemptuously called him Uncle Dwarf. Yet he was cleverer than they and often bested them in Dharma combat. He was not well loved by his peers. It was said that his innate power in displaying the innermost mystery was that of a person who could chew the iron tip of an arrow. He was very tenacious. When monks were stumped in their studies, they would say, ""You only have to ask Uncle Dwarf."" He was a high-maintenance monk -- the burr under the saddle of many of his teachers. (Wick)

After several years and after receiving Dharma transmission, he left his master and, in Fuzhou, founded a new monastery, which he named Caoshan (Mount Cao), in honor of the Sixth Patriarch Huineng , whose monastery was called Caoxi (Cao Stream). In teaching, he used Dongshan's wuwei system (five ranks, relations), which helped to spread it and to separate the teaching style of the Caodong School from others. He had 14 enlightened students, of whom the most outstanding was Yunju Daoying (830-902), who is however considered a student of Dongshan.

Later he became a student of Xuefeng Yicun (822 - 902) in Fuzhou. He had great difficulty with Chan practice and seemed to be making no progress. Tradition holds that he wore out seven meditation cushions. Xuefeng provided Changqing with ""the medicine a horse doctor uses to bring a dead horse alive again.” He instructed Changqing to practice meditation in the hall as if he were a ""dead tree stump.” Changqing followed this practice for two and a half years. When he could no longer sit, he went to the monastery garden. late one night, after others had gone to bed, he rolled up a bamboo screen and his eye fell upon the light of a lantern. At that moment he woke up. Changqing was with Xuefeng for 29 years. Then, in 908, the governor of Fuzhou, Wang Yanbin, invited Changqing to become abbot of the Changqing Monastery. He served in that capacity for 20 years. He had 1,500 students and 26 of them achieved enlightenment.

Dayang transmitted his dharma to Xingyan, the only student he had that he found worthy, but Xingyuan died before his teacher. With the Caodong school in serious decline and without a worthy heir, Dayang feared that the Caodong line would end with his death.

Leaving home to become a monk at the relatively late age of thirty-five, he traveled to Chengdu to study the doctrines of the Consciousness-Only school of Buddhism. However, Wuzu was troubled by the proposition that when a bodhisattva enters the Way, wisdom and principle are eclipsed, and though environment and mind are reportedly realized as fully united, no evidence can be offered to affirm the truth of this unity. With this doubt in mind, Wuzu made inquiries to a Tripitaka master about the nature of knowledge. Wuzu then left to seek out a teacher [of the buddha mind doctrine]. Wuzu's arduous journey led him to seek out Zen masters Yuanzhao and Fushan Fayuan, but neither of these teachers brought Wuzu to a full awakening. Finally, he traveled to Baiyun Shouduan's temple where he attained enlightenment. Wuzu's fame as a teacher spread widely and students gathered from throughout China to study under him.
