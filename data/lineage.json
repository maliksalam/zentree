In his youth, Puji is said to have studied a wide range of Buddhist scriptures before ordaining at the age of thirty-eight. Soon afterwards, he left to study with Shenxiu at Yuquansi (Jade Spring Monastery) on Mt. Dangy ang in Jingzhou. As the best-known disciple of Shenxiu, Puji was one of the subjects of a series of polemical attacks by the HEZE SHENHUI (684Ð758) beginning in 732. Shenhui denounced Puji and other disciples of Shenxiu as representing a mere collateral branch of BODHIDHARMA's lineage and for promoting what Shenhui called a \"gradualÓ (jian) approach to enlightenment. Shenhui instead promoted a \"sudden teachingÓ (DUNJIAO), which he claimed derived from a so-called \"Southern schoolÓ (NAN ZONG) founded by HUINENG (638Ð713), whom Shenhui claimed was the true successor of the fifth patriarch HONGREN (601Ð74). Later Chan historians such as GUIFENG ZONGMI (780Ð841) came to refer to a \"Northern schoolÓ (Bei zong) of Chan to describe this lineage of Shenxiu's, to which Puji, Yifu (661Ð736), and XIANGMO ZANG (d.u.) were said to have belonged.\n        "

In his youth, he prepared for a career in administration, becoming well educated in Confucian texts. While traveling to the capital, Chang'an, to take the civil service examination, he had a dream that the whole room was filled with white light. Asking a fortune teller about this dream, he was told that his dream foretold a solution to emptiness. He then met a Chan monk, who asked him what his goal was. \"I've decided to become a functionary,\" said Danxia. \"What does the decision to become a functionary amount to compared with the decision to become a buddha?\" replied the monk. \"Where can I go if I want to become a buddha?\" Danxia then asked. The monk suggested that he seek out the great Chan master Mazu, whereupon Danxia unhesitatingly set out to do so. Mazu soon sent him on to Shitou, under whom Danxia trained for some years. He went on to become one of Shitou's dharma successors. Later he returned to Mazu. Arriving in Mazu's monastery he sat himself astride the neck of a statue of Manjushri. The monks, upset by the outrageous behavior of the newcomer, reported this to Mazu, who came to see Danxia. \"You are very natural, my son,\" said Mazu. From this incident Danxia's monastic name Tianran (the Natural) is derived. After the death of Mazu, Danxia went on wandering pilgrimage and visited other great Chan masters of the time in order to train further. For three years he practiced in the monastery at the top of Huading Tiantai mountains. He also practiced for a time with master Jingshan Daoqin (714-792) from niutou school. During his wandering years he stopped to spend the night in a Ch'an temple. The night being cold, he took a wooden buddha off the shrine, made a fire with it, and warmed himself. When the head monk took him to task, Danxia said, \"I'll get the bones of the Buddha out of the ashes.\" \"How can you expect to find Buddha's bones in wood?\" asked the head monk. Danxia replied, \"Why are you berating me then for burning the wood?!\"\n<br>At the age of eighty-one, he settled in a hermitage on Mount Danxia (in Hunan Province) from which his name is derived. Soon up to 300 students gathered there around him and built a monastery. Four years after his arrival on Mount Danxia, he suddenly said one day, \"I'm going on a journey once again.\" He picked up his hat and his pilgrim's robe and staff. When he had put on the second of his pilgrim's sandals, he passed away before his foot again touched the ground.

Tai at the age 23, and began studying the Vinaya. Finding this path to be too slow, he traveled to Mt. Gui, where he studied with Guishan Lingyou and worked preparing food in the kitchen. Later, he was a disciple of Yaoshan, and then of Yaoshan's disciple, Daowu. After Daowu's death, and during the Huishang persecution (845-847), Shishuang stayed in Linyang working as a ceramic assistant. When the persecution ended, Dongshan Liangjie sent his monk to find him. Eventually, Shishuang constructed his temple on Mt. Shishuang in Hunan Province, and taught there for 20 years. (Another Chan master, Shishuang Chuyuan, taught at this location about 200 years later.) Shishuang created \"seven instructions to practice,\" short maxims to help his students in meditation, such as \"cold ash or dry wood,\" \"white silk,\" \"censer in an old temple,\" etc. These maxims were criticized, along with \"silent illumination\" generally, by Dahui Zonggao. Some of Shishuang's students meditated extremely rigorously, without movement, even without sleeping. Shishuang's reputation spread to Emperor Xizong, who offered him an honorary purple robe, which Shishuang did not accept.

Yunyan stayed with Baizhang, 20 years, until Baizhang's death. He then visited many teachers before settling with Yaoshan Weiyan (751-834). Yunyan later taught at Yunyan Mountain (\"Cold Crag Mountain\"), near modern Changsha. Recorded dialogues involving Yunyan often also include Daowu Yuanzhi (769-835), his fellow student (and maybe his biological brother) under Yaoshan. Yunyan supposedly died from illness, the day before which he ordered his students to prepare for a banquet because a monk was preparing to depart the monastery. Some sources say that both Dongshan's Five Ranks and the \"Song of the Jeweled-Mirror Samadhi\" (usually attributed to Dongshan) were actually passed down to Dongshan from Yunyan.

He started private studies in Chan at a young age, and showed promise by questioning the fundamental Doctrine of the Six Roots during his tutor's recitation of the Heart Sutra. Though only 10-years-old, he then left home to train with Lingmo at the monastery on Wutai Mountain. At 21, he went to Shaolin Monastery on Mount Song, where he took the complete monk's precepts. He wandered extensively among the Chan masters and hermits in the Hongzhou region. He studied with Nanquan (748-835), and then with Guishan (771-853), before settling down with Yunyan. At 52, Dongshan established a school at Mount Dong, Rui Region (Jiangxi) where he had 500-1,000 students at any given time. He is the founder of the Caodong (Soto) school, one of the Five Houses of Zen, named after him and his pupil, Caoshan (Hence \"Caodong\" from CAOshan + DONGshan -- in Japanese, \"Soto\" from SOzan + TOzan). Dongshan announced the end of his life several days before the event and told his students to create a \"delusion banquet.\" After a week of preparations, he took one bite of the meal and, telling the students not to \"make a great commotion over nothing,\" went to his room and died.\nDongshan is the author of the \"Song of the Jeweled-Mirror Samadhi\", and is also known for his teaching on \"The Five Ranks\" (The Absolute within the Relative; The Relative within the Absolute; The Coming from Within the Absolute; The Contrasted Relative Alone; and Unity Attained).

Dayang in Yingzhou (now the city of Jingshan in Hubei Province) where he met and studied with Huijian; upon Huijian's death, assumed the abbacy of the temple.\nDayang transmitted his dharma to Xingyan, the only student he had that he found worthy, but Xingyuan died before his teacher. With the Caodong school in serious decline and without a worthy heir, Dayang feared that the Caodong line would end with his death. Thus, Dayang took the unprecedented step of enlisting the assistance of Fushan Fayuan (Fuzan Hoen, 991-1067, 17th gen), an eminent teacher of the Linji lineage. In 1023, at age 80, Dayang entrusted to Fushan the Dharma transmission of the Caodong school.

Thus, Touzi \"was the Caodong Zen school Dharma heir, but not the direct student, of Dayang Jingxuan. He came from ancient Qingshe (near the modern city of Yanshi in Henan Province). According to the Wudeng Huiyuan, he left lay life at the age of seven to live at Miaoxiang Temple. Initially, he studied the \"hundred dharmas doctrineÓ of the Consciousness-Only school of Buddhism. One day he said, \"(This doctrine) is obscure and extensive. Of what advantage is all of this difficulty?Ó Later he undertook the practices of the Huayan school, but upon reading the words \"Mind is self-nature,Ó he had an insight, saying, \"Dharma is not found in the written word, and how can one speak of it?Ó He then went traveling to find and study under a Zen teacher.\" (Ferguson)\n        <br><br><b>Works:</b> <i>Empty Valley Collection (Complied and annotated)</i>",

He came from ancient Jizhou (the site of the modern city of Ji'an in Jiangxi Province). Shushan eventually lived and taught at Mt. Shu. He was very short in physical stature, and thus earned the nick-name \"the dwarf teacher.Ó (Ferguson) He seems to have been a rather contradictory fellow who traveled around a lot to many teachers. In addition to being short, apparently he was also ugly and often sickly. The other monks contemptuously called him Uncle Dwarf. Yet he was cleverer than they and often bested them in Dharma combat. He was not well loved by his peers. It was said that his innate power in displaying the innermost mystery was that of a person who could chew the iron tip of an arrow. He was very tenacious. When monks were stumped in their studies, they would say, \"You only have to ask Uncle Dwarf.\" He was a high-maintenance monk -- the burr under the saddle of many of his teachers.

Caoshan was born in Putian in Quanzhou, Fujian Province to the Huang family. In his youth he studied Confucianism. He left home at 19 and entered the Linji Monastery in Futang, Fuzhou. At age 25, he became a monk and, soon after, student of Dongshan Liangjie , whom he met at Dong Mountain. After several years and after receiving Dharma transmission, he left his master and, in Fuzhou, founded a new monastery, which he named Caoshan (Mount Cao), in honor of the Sixth Patriarch Huineng , whose monastery was called Caoxi (Cao Stream). In teaching, he used Dongshan's wuwei system (five ranks, relations), which helped to spread it and to separate the teaching style of the Caodong School from others. He had 14 enlightened students, of whom the most outstanding was Yunju Daoying (830-902), who is however considered a student of Dongshan.\n<br>Appears in: GG10, BOS52, BOS73\n        "

Decheng pulled him up and said,\"Today I have finally caught a big golden fish!\" The two stayed all night on the river, sometimes talking, sometimes silent.

After taking the monk's vows at age twenty, he focused on sutra study. One day while lecturing to the assembly about a sutra, a visiting monk, Daowu Yuanzhi (769-835), began laughing and said that Jiashan needed a teacher because his sutra lecture was missing the point. Daowu recommended that Jiashan go see Chuanzi, \"the Boat Monk,\" Daowu's dharma brother who \"hasn't a tile to cover his head above, nor a gimlet point of earth to stand on below.\" Although Jiashan's understanding of Buddhism was already extensive, he did not attain complete awakening until meeting Chuanzi. After giving transmission to Jiashan, his only successor, Decheng told him to avoid crowded cities, live in the mountains, and concentrate on finding a successor to keep the dharma alive. He then tipped over his boat and was never seen again. Jiashan then moved into the mountains to live in seclusion, but large numbers of students came to study with him, building thatched huts scattered around Jiashan's. Finally, in 870, the assembly moved to Mt. Jia where they built a temple. Jiashan was the first Zen master known to closely link Zen with drinking tea. He described their intimacy as \"Zen, tea, one taste.Ó\n<br>Appears in: BOS35, BOS68\n        ",

To show his gratitude, Longtan made a daily offering of ten cakes to the master. The master accepted the cakes, but every day he consumed only nine and returned the remaining one to Longtan, saying, \"This is my gift to you in order to prosper your descendants.\" One day, Longtan became curious, saying to himself, \"It is I who bring him the cakes; how is it then that he returns one of them as a present to me? Can there be some secret meaning in this?\" So the young boy made bold to put the question before the master. The master said, \"What wrong is there to restore to you what originally belonged to you?\" Longtan apprehended the hidden meaning, and decided to be a novice, attending upon the master with great diligence. After some time, Longtan said to the master, \"Since I came, I have not received any essential instructions on the mind from you, master.\" The master replied, \"Ever since you came, I have not ceased for a moment to give you essential instructions about the mind.\" More mystified than ever, the disciple asked, \"On what points have you instructed me?\" The master replied, \"Whenever you bring me the tea, I take it from your hands. Whenever you serve the meal, I accept it and eat it. Whenever you salute me, I lower my head in response. On what points have I failed to show you the essence of the mind?\" Longtan lowered his head and remained silent for a long time. The master said, \"For true perception, you must see right on the spot. As soon as you begin to ponder and reflect, you miss it.\" At these words, Longtan's mind was opened and he understood. Then he asked how to preserve this insight. The master said, \"Give rein to your Nature in its transcendental roamings. Act according to the exigencies of circumstances in perfect freedom and without any attachment. Just follow the dictates of your ordinary mind and heart.

Deshan was a scholar focused on the Vinaya, and became famous for his knowledge of the Diamond Sutra. After an encounter with an old woman convinced him that scriptural study was insufficient, he studied Zen under Longtan. Under Emperor Wuzong of Tang a brief but intense Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution forced Deshan from a thirty year long position in Lizhou into hiding on Mt. Dufu. Afterwards the governor of Wuleng in the Lang Region (Hunan) asked Deshan to come to live on Mount Virtue (Mount De, i.e. Deshan), where he established his monastery and taught.

At age 19, the five-year suppression of Buddhism (841-846) forced Xuefeng from the monastery, yet his training continued, now with Yuanzhao on Lotus Mountain (Hunan). When the suppression ended, Xuefeng began traveling around, visiting various monasteries in Northern China before settling down at Wuling (Hunan) to study with Deshan. At length, Deshan authorized him to teach, and Xuefeng returned to Lotus Mountain and built a monastery on the top of Guangfu Xuefeng (Snow Summit), in the Fu Region (Fujian). In the mid-870s, his monastery was officially recognized by the authorities and his teachings were supported by several officials in the region, leading eventually to Xuefeng receiving from Emperor Xizong a purple robe and the title of \"Grand Master of the truly enlightened.\" In 891, now almost 70, Xuefeng went traveling again. Soon he joined the attendants of Yang Xingmi, ruler of the newly established Wu regime, \"cleansing soldiers with dharma-rain and performing ceremonies at Chan monasteries\". This strengthened his reputation \"as a Buddhist prelate who administered to the needs of local rulers\". In 894, he returned to the Min region, where he lived out his days as a state prelate, a master with a central role in promoting Buddhism who spread his influence throughout the region. Posthumous name: Great Master Zhenjue. Two of the Five Houses of Zen descend from Xuefeng: the Yunmen school (from Xuefeng's immediate heir, Yunmen), and the Fayan school (from heir Xuansha to Luohan to Fayan).\n<br>Appears in GG13/BOS55, BCR5, BCR22/BOS24, BCR51/BOS50, BCR66\n        <br><br><b>Works:</b> <i>Record of Discussions in the Palace regarding the Buddha Mind-seal (not available in English) records Xuefeng's conversations with Wang Shenzhi.</i>",

At the rather late age of thirty he left lay life to enter a temple on Lotus Mountain. Later he was ordained by the Vinaya master Lingxun at Kaiyuan Temple in Yuzhang (near modern Nanchang). He carried on an ascetic practice, wearing only a patched robe and straw sandals. (\"With straw sandals, muslin clothing, and turnips for food, he was content\" --Wansong, BOS81). He often fasted instead of taking the evening meal, and was regarded as unusual by the other monks. He was called \"Ascetic Bei.Ó His relationship with Xuefeng was like that of a younger brother. As his close disciple, Xuansha worked with Xuefeng to build his teacher's practice center. He is said to have awakened one day upon reading the words of the Surangama Sutra. After leaving Xuefeng he first lived at the Puying Monastery. Later he moved to Xuansha Mountain in Fuzhou, where he remained for the next thirty years.

Classical records say that from early childhood he could speak very well and would not eat meat. He was ordained at Wansui Temple, located in his home province, under a teacher named Wuxiang. At first he closely followed the teachings of the Vinaya, but later declared that just guarding against breaking the vows and adhering to the precepts did not equal true renunciation. He then set off to explore the teachings of the Zen school. He first studied with Xuefeng Yicun, but was unsuccessful at penetrating the Way. Xuefeng's disciple, Xuansha, brought Luohan to full awakening. Dogen praises Luohan for his saying, \"The tenzo enters the kitchen.\" Luohan was also named after his temple, Dizang-yuan, named after the archtypal Bodhisattva.

He joined the Tongxuan monastery at age 13 and then practiced for some time with several Chan masters. Around 879 he studied with master Xiyuan Siming in Fujian, then he was a disciple of Lingyun Zhiqin - then began to have serious doubts about his Chan practice. Later he became a student of Xuefeng Yicun (822 - 902) in Fuzhou. He had great difficulty with Chan practice and seemed to be making no progress. Tradition holds that he wore out seven meditation cushions. Xuefeng provided Changqing with \"the medicine a horse doctor uses to bring a dead horse alive again.Ó He instructed Changqing to practice meditation in the hall as if he were a \"dead tree stump.Ó Changqing followed this practice for two and a half years. When he could no longer sit, he went to the monastery garden. late one night, after others had gone to bed, he rolled up a bamboo screen and his eye fell upon the light of a lantern. At that moment he woke up. Changqing was with Xuefeng for 29 years. Then, in 908, the governor of Fuzhou, Wang Yanbin, invited Changqing to become abbot of the Changqing Monastery. He served in that capacity for 20 years. He had 1,500 students and 26 of them achieved enlightenment.\n<br>Appears in: BCR8/BOS71, BCR22/BOS24, BCR23, BCR74, BCR76, BCR93, BCR95.\n        ",

Born into a prominent and wealthy family, the young man possessed extraordinary skills as a scholar. Determined to leave secular life and enter the Buddhist priesthood, he entered the Pu'an Monastery in Yizhou (near modern Chengdu City), where he studied the Buddhist scriptures under a teacher named Renxian. Xuedou was recognized as an adept in both Buddhist and non-Buddhist disciplines. After receiving ordination he traveled to ancient Fuzhou (near the modern city of Tianmen in Hubei Province), where he studied under Zhimen Guangzuo. After five years Xuedou received Zhimen's seal as an heir of the Yunmen lineage. Xuedou later lived at the Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou and Cuifeng Temple in Suzhou before finally taking up residence on Mt. Xuedou (near modern Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province). Xuedou compiled the hundred k_ans that are the core of the Blue Cliff Record, the well-known Zen text later annotated by Zen master Yuanwu Keqin. Xuedou's grand style of teaching rejuvenated the Yunmen lineage. The prominent Zen master Tianyi Yihuai was among his eighty-four disciples.\" (Andy Ferguson)\n<br>Appears in: BOS26\n        <br><br><b>Works:</b> <i>The Blue Cliff Record (Complied and annotated)</i>",

He did not become the master of a fine large temple, but he had some disciples\" (Sekida). \"After enlightenment, before accepting a request to dwell in a monastery as the guide of a community, Chan adepts usually spent years travelling and/or living in seclusion or semi-seclusion, 'maturing the holy embryo.' Some, like Lianhua, remained in humble circumstances as hermits all their lives, though small groups of seekers would come to live near them and call on them for instruction. The saying in BCR25 was spoken by the hermit just before he died\" (Cleary & Cleary)\n<br>Appears in: BCR25\n        "

Well-educated as a child, he entered monastic life as a teen under the teacher Huizhao, where the older novice who would become Master Yaoshan was also studying. After his full ordination at Mt. Heng, he moved to Lujian (in modern Anhui province) where he studied Buddhist scriptures. Then, while still in his twenties, he sought out Master Mazu at Gonggong Mountain in southern Jiangxi and became his disciple.\nBaizhang established an early set of rules for Chan monastic discipline, the Pure Rules of Baizhang, and is also credited with originating the Chinese tea ceremony. He founded Baizhang monastery, which contained a monks hall, an innovation which became typical for Chan. Both the lifestyle he spelled out as well as the architectural form of his monastery became models for later Zen monasteries. As the Zen monks farmed, it helped them to survive the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution more than other sects which relied more on donations. Baizhang's rules are still used today in many Zen monasteries. His rules include the aphorism, \"A day without work is a day without food.\"\nAppears in: BCR73/BOS6, BCR53, BOS8, GG2, BCR26, BCR70, BCR71, BCR72, GG40\n        ",

Huangbo (he would later teach at a different monastery with the same name) in Fujian province. During his period of traveling around seeking instructions from various Chan masters, he visited Mt. Tiantai and received teachings from National Teacher Nanyang Huizhong (675-775). He may also have studied briefly under Nanquan Puyuan (748-835) before settling down with Baizhang Huaihai. When Huangbo, who was quite tall, first met Baizhang, Baizhang exclaimed, \"Magnificent! Imposing! Where have you come from?\" Huangbo replied, \"Magnificent and imposing, I've come from the mountains.\"\nIn 842, Pei Xiu, a government official in Kiangsi province, invited Huangbo to be resident teacher at Lung-hsing Monastery. Pei eventually built a monastery for Hungb around 846, which the master named Huangbo after the mountain where he had been a novice monk.\nCentral teaching: centered on the concept of \"mind\" (or \"heart/mind\") Mind cannot be sought by the mind. \"Mind is the Buddha,\" he said. \"All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing but the One Mind, beside which nothing exists. The One Mind alone is the Buddha, and there is no distinction between the Buddha and sentient beings.\" And: \"To awaken suddenly to the fact that your own Mind is the Buddha, that there is nothing to be attained or a single action to be performed - this is the Supreme Way.\"\nAs many of Huangbo's themes and phrasings are echoed in the record of his student, Linji, Huangbo is sometimes regarded as the true founder of the Linji school.\nPosthumous name: Tuan Chi Chan Shih (Chan Master Without Limits)\n<br>Appears in: GG2, BCR11/BOS53, BOS86\n        <br><br><b>Works:</b> <i>Books: John Blofield, trans.

He studied Confucianism as a youth and failed on his first attempt to pass the state civil exams. In disappointment, he left home and entered the Kaiyuan Monastery, where he received ordination under the Vinaya master Zhigong. He delved into the Lotus Sutra and practiced the zhiguan style of self-cultivation used in the Tiantai school. Fengxue traveled to broaden his understanding and studies. At the age of twenty-five, he studied with Zen master Jingqing Daofu. Still unsuccessful at uncovering the root of Zen, he continued his travels, and eventually studied under the rigorous Zen master Nanyuan Huiyong. He remained with Nanyuan for six years, finally awakening to the Way and becoming his teacher's Dharma heir. In 931, Fengxue traveled to Ruzhou, where he began teaching at the already old and dilapidated Fengxue Temple. There he derived his mountain name. News of Fengxue's ability spread, and before long Zen students gathered around him. The temple's poor physical condition was beyond repair, however, and in the year 951 Fengxue and his students moved to the newly built Guanghui Temple. Fengxue remained there as abbot for twenty-two years.\n<br>Appears in: GG24, BCR38/BOS29, BCR61/BOS34\n        ",

A great transmitter of the Yangqi line of Linji Zen, Wuzu's teaching exerted profound influence on subsequent generations of Zen teachers and on wider Song dynasty society. Leaving home to become a monk at the relatively late age of thirty-five, he traveled to Chengdu to study the doctrines of the Consciousness-Only school of Buddhism. However, Wuzu was troubled by the proposition that when a bodhisattva enters the Way, wisdom and principle are eclipsed, and though environment and mind are reportedly realized as fully united, no evidence can be offered to affirm the truth of this unity. With this doubt in mind, Wuzu made inquiries to a Tripitaka master about the nature of knowledge. Wuzu then left to seek out a teacher [of the buddha mind doctrine]. Wuzu's arduous journey led him to seek out Zen masters Yuanzhao and Fushan Fayuan, but neither of these teachers brought Wuzu to a full awakening. Finally, he traveled to Baiyun Shouduan's temple where he attained enlightenment. Wuzu's fame as a teacher spread widely and students gathered from throughout China to study under him. He first taught at Simian Shan (\"Four Face MountainÓ), and then moved to Mt. Baiyun. Later he moved to the Dongchan (\"East ZenÓ) Temple on Wuzu Mountain\" located near the site of the modern city of Huangmei in Hubei Province (Ferguson).\n<br>Appears in: GG35, GG36, GG38, GG45\n        ",

She began studying with Man Gong at the age of 25 and received transmission at the age of 29. She was a major administrator, a widely respected unsa, and was known for her tireless energy, working during the day, practicing most of the night, sleeping only about two hours a night. She never gave a dharma talk and left no written record. Her teaching was largely by example. Apparently the first nun in the modern era of Korean Buddhism to be taken seriously by the monks, she had a great influence on the nuns' order, both in her own right and from her dharma descendants. The Chogye web page describes her as establishing a woman's lineage, and describes nine of her students as Masters.\n        "

His mother was of Korean descent, and his father was of Chinese Hakka origin.\n\nIn 1974, he met Zen Master Seung Sahn, and soon became one of his most dedicated students in America. Between 1975 and 1981 he helped establish the Dharma Zen Centre in Los Angeles, and helped build many Buddhist temples and pagodas in North America. In 1981, he received 'inka', the authority to lead retreats and teach kong-an practice, and also served as Abbot of Dharma Zen Centre. In 1983, he was ordained as a monk and given the name Mu Deung.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1994, he led thirteen 90-days Kyol Che retreats in the United States, as well as the Su Dok Sah, Shin Won Sah and Hwa Gye Sah temples in Korea. He also made many teaching trips to Western and Eastern Europe especially Poland and Russia. In October 1992, at a formal ceremony in Providence Zen Centre, he received transmission of the Dharma from Zen Master Seung Sahn, and the Enlightenment name of Su Bong Soen Sa, meaning \"Extraordinary Peak\".\n\nBetween 1990 and 1994 he taught extensively in South Africa and Hong Kong. Together with Zen Master Seung Sahn, Zen Master Su Bong brought Zen teaching to China, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia. He was the guiding teacher for the Hong Kong Sangha, the South African Sangha, the Seoul International Sangha, and the Queensland, Australia, Sangha.\n\nOn July 17, 1994, when Zen Master Su Bong was giving an interview to a young girl aged fourteen in Hong Kong Zen Centre, he asked the young girl: \"What is the universal sound?\" The young girl hit the floor. Zen Master said: \"Correct\", and then passed into Nirvana, sitting up in his full Dharma robe and kasa. His bodily age was fifty-one, and his monk's age was eleven\n        "

Then, at 33, she became a Buddhist nun and Man Gong's student. She promised Man Gong that she would stop writing, but found this impossible. In the early years of her training she wrote secretly, at night, in the dark; later she wrote openly. Most of her later writing was meant to encourage others to practice Buddhism. Her own practice was fierce: in the last ten years of her life she remained in meditation posture more or less continuously, not even lying down to sleep; in her last three years her legs had atrophied to the extent that she could no longer walk.\n        "

After Zhantang's death, he studied with Yuanwu, eventually succeeding him. In 1127 the Northern Song dyasty fell to Jurchen invaders, prompting Dahui to head south where he resided with his teacher Yuanwu at Mount Yunju. In 1130, Yuanwu returned to Sichuan, and Dahui remained for a time, then moved to Yunmen, Jiangxi, then to Yangyu an, Fujian. During this time he become known for sharp criticism of \"silent illumination Zen\" and for supporting \"koan-introspecting Zen.\" In 1137, Dahui moved to Mount Jing, Zhejiang. In 1141, defrocked for his support of armed resistance against the Jurchen, Dahui went to Hangyag, Hunan, and around 1151, to Meiyang, Guangdong. Pardoned in 1155, he remained at Meiyang until imperial command returned him to Mount Jing, Zhejiang in 1158. There he taught an assembly of nearly 1,700 monks until his death.

The Guiyang school is characterized by use of symbols, symbolic actions, and metaphors, thus Guiyang Zen is the Zen school most closely aligned to Buddhsm's esoteric schools.\nAppears in: BCR70, BOS83, GG40, BCR4, BCR24/BOS60, BOS15, BOS37\n        ",

Years later, his mind far removed from his earlier confused attempts to attain what he thought to be enlightenment, Xiangyan realized the great way. Xiangyan's death is recorded as 898. Since Baizhang died in 814, Xiangyan was very young when he studied with Baizhang and very old at death.\n<br>Appears in: GG5 (Man up a tree)\n        "

When his parents at first refused permission for him to leave home to become a monk, he cut off two of his fingers to demonstrate his resolve. He studied with various masters, including Danyuan Yingzhen, disciple of National Teacher Nanyang Huizhong. With Danyuan, Yangshan had his first great insight. After Danyuan's death, he went to study with Guishan Lingyou and became Guishan's main disciple. Together they are the founders of the Guiyang school, one of the \"Five Houses of Zen\" (\"Guiyang\" from GUIshan + YANGshan). Teacher and pupil had the closest spiritual affinity. The Guiyang school is thus characterized by the gentle master-disciple-friends style of teaching, in contrast to the fervent, energetic, and often physical methods employed by other descendants of Mazu (e.g., Huangbo, Linji). The school is also distinct in its use of esoteric metaphors and imagery. Yangshan taught at Mt. Yang, Yuan Region (Jiangxi).

On the advice of an old man he met on the road, he traveled to Nanchang City in Jiangxi and began study under Baizhang Huaihai. His Dharma brother Guishan L had established temple on Mt.

When his father was transferred to Hengyang in Hunan, the young man joined him, and in this new city he married and had a daughter. Disillusioned with conventional life early on, Pang resisted the bureaucratic life expected of him, and managed to avoid a government post. Instead he devoted himself to spiritual practice, building a hermitage beside his house where he could focus on meditation. As he became more committed to simplicity, and had been joined by his wife in this pursuit, they donated their house to be made into a temple, and moved into the hermitage. Then they loaded all their valuable possessions onto a raft and sank it in a nearby lake. When asked why he didn't just give them away, Pang said that they had been a source of anxiety for him, and an impediment to the way. How could he wish that on someone else?\n<br>After this the Pang family began living off a meager income from crafting and selling bamboo utensils in the street. Soon the layman, already in his forties, decided to travel to meet teachers, and he first set off for the Heng Mountains to the north. There he found his way to the practice place of Master Shitou.\n<br>Eventually Pangyun travelled to Jiangxi to meet Master Ma. He asked his old question, \"Who is the one who isn't attached to the ten thousand things?\"\nMaster Ma said, \"When you swallow all the water in the West River in one gulp, then I'll tell you.\"\nHearing these words, Pang had another liberating awakening, and all his doubts were resolved. He practiced with Mazu for two years, and then continued his travels and encounters with other monks and teachers.\nHe stayed for awhile on Medicine Mountain with Master Shitou's disciple Master Yaoshan, and also became close friends with another of Shitou's disciples, the irreverent and free-spirited adept Danxia Tianran. Between excursions he would return to his wife and daughter in Hengyang.\n<br>Both his wife and daughter had also become deeply devoted to the spiritual path, and all three were eventually recognized for their clear wisdom. The layman was particularly close to his precocious daughter Lingzhao whose sharp wit could often outdo her father.\n<br>Toward the end of his life Pangyun traveled north toward his birthplace of Xiangyang with his beloved daughter Lingzhao, herself now an adept. The two found a cave south of Deer Gate Mountain in Xiang province, and there settled into retreat for the last years of Pangyun's life.\n        <br><br><b>Works:</b> <i>The Recorded Sayings of Layman Pang</i>",

After that, Zhaozhou spent more than 20 years on pilgrimage, visiting various prominent Chan masters. At age 80, he settled at Guanyin and for the next 40 years taught a small group of monks until his death at age 120. Zhaozhou is often regarded as the greatest Chan master of Tang dynasty China. Because of the many wars and purges of Buddhism in the China of the time, Zhaozhou's lineage died out quickly -- he had one heir, Yanyang, and he had no known heirs.\n<br>Appears in: GG14/BCR63-64/BOS9, GG19, GG1, BOS18, GG7/BOS39, GG11, GG31/BOS10, GG37/BOS47, BCR2, BCR9, BCR30, BCR41/BOS63, BCR45, BCR52, BCR57, BCR58, BCR59, BCR80, BCR96, BOS57\n        <br><br><b>Works:</b> <i>Radical Zen: The Sayings of Joshu (Trans with commentary by Yoel Hoffman, 1978).

He grew up in a prominent wealthy family that had relations to the Tang royalty. Entering the monastic life in his youth at a local temple, he later received full ordination at Hengshan in Hunan. Soon after he traveled to Jiangxi where he first encountered Master Ma at Gonggong Mountain. He became a student of the master just before the master's move north, and then followed him to the new monastery in Hongzhou. Studying with the master for many years, he became one of Mazu's most senior disciples.<br>\nAfter the passing of Master Ma, Qi'an was invited to teach in several places, and he eventually settled in a monastery built for him in Yanguan (near Hangzhou in his native province). Helped, no doubt, by his family connections, he soon became a famous teacher and was visited by numerous scholars and dignitaries as well as training monks.<br>\nMaster Yanguan was once visited by a Japanese monk on a mission from the Empress Tachibana Kachiko of Japan. The monk asked Master Yanguan if he had a disciple he could send to Japan to instruct the Empress, who had become interested in Zen teaching after hearing about it from the monk Kukai, the founder of Japanese esoteric Buddhism (who had traveled in China). Master Yanguan sent his disciple Yikung, who thus became the first Zen teacher in Japan, and the Empress, who later became a nun, became the first Zen student. Yikung, however, eventually returned to China without establishing an enduring following in Japan.<br>\nToward the end of Master Yanguan's long life, the Emperor Wuzong came to power and began to implement a persecution of Buddhist institutions and clergy. Probably because of Yanguan's high-placed connections, his monastery was relatively protected from destruction, and from the defrocking of monks that went on elsewhere. Li Chen, the expected future emperor, came to the safe haven of Yanguan's monastery to keep a low profile for a while during the politically turbulent times. Greatly impressed by the master, when he eventually ascended to the throne and became Emperor Xuanzong, he ended the persecutions and became a generous supporter of the monastic order.\n<br>Appears in: BCR91\n        ",
